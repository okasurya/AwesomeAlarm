# Awesome Alarm

Call me a megalomania upon my own phone.
So here is the story why I started this project.
I have a phone, an android phone (meh) and the clock app is always broken. I have a spare time in my weekend with nothing to do. So I decided to create my own alarm application.

I know it will be a lot of bug and desperately needs a lot of features.
But for now, it will be enough, my life is so bad without any alarm wakes me up in the morning.

Good bye and see ya in the next commit.
